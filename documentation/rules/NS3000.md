## Cause

Accessing call arguments out of the bounds of method arguments.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when `CallInfo` tries to access call arguments at position outside of the bounds of method arguments.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use an index for call arguments that is within the bounds of method arguments.

For example, if a method has 4 arguments, use indexes `0`, `1`, `2` or `3` for 1st through 4th arguments respectively.

## How to suppress violations

This warning can be suppressed by disabling the warning in the **ruleset** file for the project.
The warning can also be suppressed programmatically for an assembly:
````c#
[assembly: System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Argument specification", "NS3000:Unable to find matching argument.", Justification = "Reviewed"]
````

Or for a specific code block:
````c#
#pragma warning disable NS3000 // Unable to find matching argument.
// the code which produces warning
#pragma warning restore NS3000 // Unable to find matching argument.
