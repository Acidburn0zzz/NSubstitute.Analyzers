## How to suppress violations

This warning can be suppressed by disabling the warning in the **ruleset** file for the project.
The warning can also be suppressed programmatically for an assembly:
````c#
[assembly: System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Call configuration", "NS4000:Re-entrant substitute call.", Justification = "Reviewed")]
````

Or for a specific code block:
````c#
#pragma warning disable NS4000 // Re-entrant substitute call.
// the code which produces warning
#pragma warning restore NS4000 // Re-entrant substitute call.
