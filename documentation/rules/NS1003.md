## Cause

Substituting for an internal member of a class without proxies having visibility into internal members.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when using NSubstitute features like `Returns()`, `Received()` etc. with an internal member of a class, but without giving NSubstitute's proxy assembly access to internal members.

## How to fix violations

There are several ways to fix this:

* change the visibility of the member being tested from `internal` to `public`
* change the visibility of the member being tested from `internal` to `protected internal`
* expose your type being tested to `DynamicProxyGenAssembly2` using:
````c#
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("DynamicProxyGenAssembly2")]
````

## How to suppress violations

This warning can be suppressed by disabling the warning in the **ruleset** file for the project.
The warning can also be suppressed programmatically for an assembly:
````c#
[assembly: System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Non virtual substitution", "NS1003:Non-virtual setup specification.", Justification = "Reviewed")]
````

Or for a specific code block:
````c#
#pragma warning disable NS1003 // Non-virtual setup specification.
// the code which produces warning
#pragma warning restore NS1003 // Non-virtual setup specification.
````
