This warning can be suppressed by disabling the warning in the **ruleset** file for the project or by suppressing it (for selected members) in `nsubstitute.json` file. See the [configuration](../Configuration.md) section for details on how to set this up.
The warning can also be suppressed programmatically for an assembly:
````c#
[assembly: System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Non virtual substitution", "NS1000:Non-virtual setup specification.", Justification = "Reviewed")]
````

Or for a specific code block:
````c#
#pragma warning disable NS1000 // Non-virtual setup specification.
// the code which produces warning
#pragma warning restore NS1000 // Non-virtual setup specification.
````
